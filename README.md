DRM-Android-Core
=====================

## Modules

### org.librarysimplified.drm.core

The `org.librarysimplified.drm.core` module provides the core DRM types. Applications
are expected to depend on this module regardless of whether or not
they have support for DRM enabled (because it provides classes that
attempt to load DRM libraries at run-time).

### org.librarysimplified.drm.core.tests

The `org.librarysimplified.drm.core.tests` module provides unit tests that will be
executed on an attached Android device during the build.
